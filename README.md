# colour.mod
Go packages for dealing with colours.

The colour package contains various named colour values (in color.RGBA
form). There are several different families of named colours and functions
allowing you to retrieve the named values. The families of colours include
HTML colours, X11 colours and Pantone colours. This also allows you to
translate a colour back into a name (if a name is known)

The colourtesthelper package offers a function to check two colours and to
report differences.
